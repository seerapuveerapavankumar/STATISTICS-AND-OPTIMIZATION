## üìé How to Use

### **Learning Process**  
To get the most out of this project and learn about statistical methods and optimization techniques, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Dataset**  
   - Load and examine the dataset using **Pandas** to understand the variables and their distributions.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
     df.describe()
     df.info()
     ```

2. **Perform Statistical Analysis**  
   - Open the **statistical_analysis.py** file and apply various statistical techniques:
     - **Descriptive statistics**: Understand the basic properties of the data.
     - **Hypothesis testing**: Test assumptions or make inferences about a population from a sample.
     - **Regression analysis**: Use linear regression to model relationships between variables.

3. **Apply Optimization Techniques**  
   - Open **optimization_models.py** and implement different optimization models based on the problem at hand.
     - **Linear Programming**: Solve problems such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost while satisfying constraints.
     - **Integer Programming**: Solve problems with discrete variables, such as optimizing shipping routes or job scheduling.
     - **Non-Linear Optimization**: Handle more complex problems with non-linear objective functions.

4. **Visualize Data and Results**  
   - Use **visualizations.py** to plot and visualize data distributions, regression results, and optimization outputs.
   - Visualizations help interpret the data better and allow you to present results in an easily understandable format.

### **Execution**  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seerapuveerapavankumar/STATISTICS-AND-OPTIMIZATION.git
   ```

2. **Install necessary libraries**  
   Make sure to install all required dependencies before running the scripts:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pulp
   ```

3. **Run the `statistical_analysis.py` file**  
   This file will perform statistical analysis on the dataset:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from scipy import stats

   df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
   # Example: Perform a T-test on two columns
   t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(df['column1'], df['column2'])
   print(f'T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}')
   ```

4. **Run the `optimization_models.py` file**  
   Apply optimization algorithms like Linear Programming to solve an optimization problem:
   ```python
   from scipy.optimize import linprog

   # Example: Maximize 4x + 3y subject to constraints
   c = [-4, -3]  # Coefficients for the objective function (negative for maximization)
   A = [[2, 1], [1, 3]]  # Coefficients for inequality constraints
   b = [8, 6]  # Right-hand side of constraints

   result = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, method='simplex')
   print(result)
   ```

5. **Visualize the results**  
   Use the **visualizations.py** script to generate charts:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns

   df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
   sns.histplot(df['column1'])
   plt.show()
   ```
